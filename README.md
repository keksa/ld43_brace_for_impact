You have two minutes to deliver important report. However your enemies noticed you running for it and fired away.  
  
If one of your engines gets hit it will get misaligned, making it harder to dodge the missiles. Also if your engine gets hit 3 times it will explode and damage another engine.  
  
You can sacrifice your engine to prevent this. But will you make it in time?
